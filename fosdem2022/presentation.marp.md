# Continuous Delivery Events

<!-- First up, we'll look into Continous Delivery Events as a concept.-->

---

# A primer on Continuous Delivery

<!-- Let's start by defining Continuous Delivery -->

* ### Ready-for-release
<!-- The same way that Continouos Integration aims to get your code integrated to the main branch, Continuous Delivery aims to get your project in a state where it can be delivered -->
* ### From idea to metrics and back again
<!-- In its widest form, Continuous Delivery supports you all the way from breaking down your initial idea through getting metrics from your release project, and using those metrics as the basis for your next idea. -->
* ### Too big for any one system to solve
<!-- With activities ranging from verification and validation through packaging, release and remediation, it is not feasible to have a single "one-size-fits-all" Continouos Delivery system that solves everything. Instead, we need to rely on integrations. -->
